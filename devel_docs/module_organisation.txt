Important modules of the project (and responsibilities for each):

1. INSTALLER MODULE:
    - version check
    - update scripts between versions
    - database installer/updater
    - automatic updater

2. LANGUAGE MODULE:
    - language configuration
    - one default language
        (set at startup and when changed everything
        has to check for valid data in that language)
    - every other module must handle how the data for the selected language is fetched
        (the recommended way is to have a table column for each language:
            - it's more scalable and fast
            - e.g: some_field_en, some_field_de)

3. CURRENCY MODULE:
    - currency configuration
    - one default currency set throughout the website
    - the product module must always save the currency in which the price is set

    - rates must be imported, manually entered every day or have a script handle it,
        or have an average for a given period
